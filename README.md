# context-component-test

This repository contains example project for testing `context-component` package.

## context-component

context-component is aimed at reducing the boilerplate of writing flexible centralized state management with React context.

context-component provides extendable React class that automatically assigns its state and methods to context and provides it to its children.
It also exposes api to easily consume contexts by `connect` HOC (high order component) or by React regular context api methods - `Consumer`, `contextType` and `useContext`.
